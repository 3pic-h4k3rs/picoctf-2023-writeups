# Challenge: No way out
Points: 200

# Solution:

Find a way out of the box.

In the box is a ladder leading to an elevated platform and boxes on the ground floor, presumably there to also differentiate the elevation.

Using Cheat Engine and moving up and down elevations, it is possible to determine which varible impacts the height of the player.

Editing this value slightly higher causes the player to escape the box, and reaching the flag will give the flag to the challenge.


The rest is left as an exercise for the reader.
