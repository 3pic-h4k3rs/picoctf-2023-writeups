# Challenge: two-sum
Points: 100

# Solution: 

This challenge asks for two numbers in which n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2. Obviously this is impossible if we apply it to real life, so we have to find an exploit in the code to break this program. 

Looking at the code, it seems that they are looking for an integer overflow.

Searching up integer overflow, I saw that the max integer value for C is 2147483647. 

Putting 2147483647 two times, gives us the flag.
